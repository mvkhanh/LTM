# Video Streaming and Upload Platform

## Overview

This project is a **JSP/Servlet-based web application** designed for video uploading and streaming, similar to platforms like YouTube. Users can upload their own videos and view videos available on the system. Once a video is uploaded, the system processes the video to convert it into multiple resolutions for optimal streaming. Users can leave the page, and the processing continues in the background, with progress updates being displayed in real-time.

## Features

- **Video Upload**: Users can upload their videos in various formats (e.g., MP4, AVI).
- **Background Processing**: Once a video is uploaded, it is processed in the background to create multiple versions with different quality/resolution.
- **Real-Time Progress Update**: Users are notified about the upload and processing progress without needing to stay on the page.
- **Video Streaming**: Users can watch uploaded videos in various resolutions, depending on their preferences and available bandwidth.
- **User Interaction**: Users can view and interact with videos uploaded by other users, similar to video streaming platforms like YouTube.
  
## Technologies Used

- **JSP (JavaServer Pages)**: For dynamic content rendering.
- **Servlets**: For handling HTTP requests and controlling application logic.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For frontend development and user interaction.
- **Java**: For backend logic and video processing tasks.
- **FFmpeg**: For video transcoding (converting videos to different qualities).
- **Database**: To store video metadata, including details like title, description, and file paths.
  
## How It Works

1. **Video Upload**: Users select a video file to upload through a simple interface. Once the video is selected, it is sent to the server.
2. **Background Processing**: After the video is uploaded, the server triggers a background process (using Java threads or external workers) to convert the video into different qualities (e.g., 1080p, 720p, 480p).
3. **Progress Updates**: During the processing phase, the system continuously updates the user with the current progress through AJAX requests.
4. **Streaming**: Once the video is processed, it can be streamed by other users directly on the platform in their chosen resolution.
5. **Notification**: Users are notified when the video processing is complete, and they can start watching it.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
